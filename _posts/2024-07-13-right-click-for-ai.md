The integration of [AI into our desktop environment](https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/){:target="_blank"} marks the beginning of a new era of human-AI cognitive symbiosis, fundamentally altering the landscape of human cognition and potential. This incremental improvement in function to the existing technology is a pivotal moment in augmented cognition. 

Most AI interactions today are through a dedicated app or web browser.

We open a new tab or window, navigate to the appropriate site, and then frame our query or request. This process, while simple, contains a barrier that forces separation between task and AI assistance. Users must consciously remember to leverage AI capabilities, and *go to* the AI (app or site) to address a need. 

By putting AI on the desktop, it means *bringing AI to the work*. It can help you while you're typing the email, looking for the file, or needing to change a picture's dimensions. This is like the difference between google maps on your computer, and google maps in your car. With navigation in your car you no longer needed to plan trips, you just take them. More of them with less planning. What's remarkable (or scary) is that chatGPT represents a kind of cognitive navigation that is hard to summarize, let alone identify its key advantages. 

Now that AGI is built into the desktop, users only need to remember to turn on their chatbot (navigation) to start integrating into their entrenched computer habits. Until now, the uses of chatbots has been limited to the conscious imagination and efforts of early adopters. Now, AGI will be tested wherever real demands present themselves in our entrenched computer habits. This is the time where unexpected use-cases will flourish. Or cat memes.
