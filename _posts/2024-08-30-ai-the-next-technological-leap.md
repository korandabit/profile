# AI: The Next Technological Leap

The current capacity of an uninhibited, curious, and enterprising human paired with AI is capable of a new order of magnitude of creativity and discovery. There's a whole new way of being available through this. Chatbots promise to take us to new realms, extending our intellectual power more profoundly than pencils or computers ever did.

## Short-term and Long-term Goals

My long-term goal is to increase the reliability and ROI of AI. Short-term, I aim to engage in what appears to be a marketing game—helping people see the value in using chatbots. This helps keep me grounded and renders explicit the benefits I seem to be engaging.

## The Evolution of Cognitive Tools

### The Pencil and Computer

The pencil enabled the post-access brain to store and iterate on symbolic objects. The computer broadened this application, reducing countless barriers surrounding cognitive action. However, both operated on a post-access plane—you had to think of a word to leverage their benefits.

### Post-access vs. Co-access cognition

Post-access cognition refers to our ability to work with information after we've recalled or accessed it. Traditional tools like pencils and computers enhance this process. Co-access cognition, enabled by AI, occurs when the tool actively participates in the thinking process, offering relevant information and ideas before we've fully formed them ourselves. This shift allows for a more dynamic and expansive cognitive experience.

### The AI Difference

With AI, the ROI is generative in nature. AI chatbots can facilitate access, complementing your successful access. They provide value in the search box itself, engaging your thinking pre-access, exemplifying co-access cognition.

The chatbot brings all the best words of the world, most likely related to what's in your head, to you. It's autocomplete, mastered. AI models have uncovered an entire mine where we once saw flakes of gold.

## The Power of Context

Context dependencies are the implicit assumptions and background knowledge that give meaning to information. Traditional notes or reminders often lose value over time as we forget their context. AI solves this by maintaining awareness of various contexts and efficiently translating between them. This means that even a simple note can become a springboard for broader insights and applications, as the AI can reinterpret and expand on it based on changing circumstances or needs.

A once-fixed observation becomes a dynamic, interactive object with a chatbot, thanks to its ability to navigate and translate between contexts.

## Reimagining Solutions

The best leveraging of chatbots isn't just to improve all your post-it notes. We must ask, "What can we do, given that this problem is solved?" We're mostly incapable of answering this until we exercise that solution—as we live in a world that doesn't suffer from access limitations, new problems and solutions will manifest.

## Language and Beyond

Chatbots are an instant, generalizable force-multiplier of language. They cure context-specific semantics and translation barriers. In an AI world, we could make the software we need, solving problems directly rather than searching for tools.

### Made-to-order solutions vs. off-the-shelf products

Traditionally, we rely on pre-made, generalized tools and products to solve our problems. These off-the-shelf solutions often require us to adapt our needs to fit the tool. In contrast, AI enables made-to-order solutions, where the tool is created or adapted specifically for our unique situation. This shift allows for more precise, efficient, and personalized problem-solving, potentially eliminating the compromises we often make when using standardized products.

For instance, instead of searching for a generic PDF-to-JPG converter, we can directly instruct the AI to "make this a JPG," tailoring the solution to our specific needs.

## The Future Landscape

The real solutions come after we become fluent with these "for free" solutions enabled by AI's made-to-order capabilities. We'll start to see previously unsolvable problems in a new light. We'll be tasked with redefining the objects we deal with and reassessing what's feasible in this new space of co-access cognition and context-aware problem-solving.
