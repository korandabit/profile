let me say it with a full lung of air.

the current, as-is capacity of an uninhibited, curious and enterprising human paired with an AI, is capable of a new order of magnitude of creativity and discovery. i believe there is a whole class if not way of being available through this. in the way that the pencil and a computer dramatically extend the intellectual power of a person, but in a profoundly deeper way, chatbots promise to take us to new realms.

many have been interested in exploiting this, but as we know with new technology, with some level of unpredictable success. my long term goal is to increase the reliability and ROI. my short term goal is to engage in what appears to be a marketing game--helping people see the value in using chatbots. i despise marketing, but here it is a vehicle for rendering explicit the benefits i seem to be engaging, and talking to people who stand to gain something but havent yet, helps keep me grounded.

let me return to that full lung approach. the pencil enabled the post-access brain to store and iterate on symbolic objects. post-access is the key variable here -- you have to think of a word in order to leverage the pencil's benefits. one of which is to make it easier to think of the word next time (just look at it). here, the 'word' is any linguistic thing you could write down, that by writing it down, you save some time or take some action you might have forgotten to do otherwise, or done partially as well. reminders, instructions, feelings, a letter, a rent or other business agreement, whatever. 

the computer broadened this application. it reduced countless barriers that surround the cognitive action -- allowing one to more deeply iterate on a typed and saved word, share it, leverage it in more contexts. if the computer is an improvement on the pencil's technology, it is still on the same plane -- post-access. with the advent of search engines, spell-checkers and grammatical tools, the computer verged on facilitating access, as well. 

at its best, it could anticipate common avenues, but critically, common meant that at a minimum, other people had achieved post-access. if no one had thought of a word, no search algorithm or other computer aid could bring you there. this is to say that for all the potential and actual value on this plane, there was a real ceiling regards generativity.

with AI, the ROI is generative in nature. it is not complete generativity, but it is unequivocally beyond the threshold. the ai operates effectively at a co-access level. if you are engaged in a motivated cognitive action, AI chatbots can facilitate the access, let alone compliment your successful access. 

This value of this attribute can be quite hard to convey, in part because we have not had it before. The closest thing to it is a search engine result that is somewhat surprising. but the critical difference here is that the chatbot provides value in the search box itself.

i am not interested in debating whether it does this successfully, or in what cases it cannot do this any better than a search algorithm. i'm here to state and explore the cases where it is capable of engaging your thinking, pre-access. the pencil is for solidifying linguistically encoded information (or otherwise symbolically encoded). the chatbot is for finding the right words. 

to be explicit, it does NOT find the words in your head, per se, it does this in a surprising, backward way. it brings all the best words of the world, most likely related to in your head, like a search result, to you. it is autocomplete, mastered. 

a few years ago we could fantasize and worry about how autocomplete tech was just good enough to be annoying. it corrects we're vs were, but then sometimes incorrectly reverts an already correct one. it anticipated polite phrases, but sometimes for the wrong context (friendly polite for your boss, or mom-polite for your partner). 

these were the flakes of gold, to what AI models have uncovered is an entire mine. the product is not all the things you could think of, but it is so so many of them. and more to the point, so many more than you could think of, as it is sourcing the thoughts and products of billions of thoughts. 

the surprising or counterintuitive solution that the chatbots have unleashed, in the puzzle of getting you to think of the right words, is by solving the recieving end of that problem. so lets start there. suppose you already wrote down a note, "buy bread". good, quite clear, right? what use is this note in two years? not at all. you wrote it, but it was highly context dependent. the ai has solved context dependencies. it has some difficulty identifying your precise context, but generally speaking, it is a system that is deeply aware of the vast majority of contexts, and most importantly, translating between them. now, "buy bread", a note saved on Jan 3rd, could be a recurring note when the bread runs out, or an open question of what other consumable you need to replace. the once-fixed observation, is, with a chatbot, capable of being a dynamic, interactive object.

with this perspective in mind, the best leveraging of the chatbots is not to bibbity bobbity boo all your post-it notes. to do so would be an improvement, but merely a roadside stop along the new plane on which AI can travel. the answer to, "okay but what CAN it do" we really cannot name in the context of what we know right now. right now the only correct description, which is still woefully incomplete, is to say that AI *solves* what the pencil and computer could not. we ask the question, "what can we do, given that this problem is solved" and this is the right question. but i believe we are mostly incapable of answering this, unless and until we exercise that solution -- i.e., as we live in a world that does not suffer from access limitations, new problems and solutions will manifest. 

my last major essay was the richest attempt to explore this space. it asks what happens to language in this autocomplete world. chatbots are an instant, generalizable force-multiplier of language. it is a cure for the germs of context-specific semantics, translation barriers, and the like. 

a glimpse on the kinds of solutions we're confronted with are as follows. what happens when you have a publishing company's editors, a software companies developers, and a research lab's analysts at your immediate disposal? you no longer need to buy or use software, books, or run generalizable experiments. these products and their benefits are *made-to-order*. in a google world, i try to find an online tool to convert a pdf into a jpg, or read the text from it. i hope that tool doesn't have malware in it, or exploit me another way. i hope it actually does what i think it will. in our ai world, i could make the software i need. one better is, whereas a software might convert *any* pdf into a jpg, i could solve the problem directly: "make this a jpg". 

but more importantly what i'm trying to suggest is that the real solutions come after we get used to and fluent with these "for free" solutions. it comes when we can imagine beyond how to fix all the little things we've lived with, broken, the wave of incessant problems. only then do we start to see problems we have thus far never considered solveable, in a new light. just as the made-to-order solution is not out-of-box perfect, nor will the next layer of problems be obviously solveable. but what will happen is some changing of light cast on those problems, that renders one dimension or more, suddenly manageable. we are then tasked with redefining the objects we deal with, and assessing what feasible means in that new space.
