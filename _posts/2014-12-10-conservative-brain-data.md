Education, Parenting, Business, Pop culture have been running for far too long on brain myths. I stumbled across [this article](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/10-ways-brain-myths-harming-us/) and was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't filled with a list of 2-3 items duplicated to make a list worth counting on your fingers. On top of that, I echo the same concern.

Here's a simple rubric if you're eager for a summary: what we know about the brain is very, very tenuous, other than that it is a complicated thing that so far, does not generalize easily to whole populations. Most of the claims that are lead astray are ones that make assertions about the world: confirming differences, etc. But really, I would argue most of what we can actually say about the brain is still in the conservative zone of what the brain *is not:* The brain is not a computer; It's not a rote-storage machine; It's not a smaller version or reflection of all the things we think the world is. Instead, the brain in some fundamental ways has to be the *compliment*. We're still trying to crack the egg on what that means.
