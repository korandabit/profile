Dialog is two people saying words. The Point of dialog is an agreed-upon shared result (often unstated). That said, many dialogs lose the Point because of Tangents. Here is the only reminder you ever need to stick to the Point.


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


Everything said in a dialog will be a proportion of Tangents and Points. The Point is what brings the result closer. 


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


For example, in trying to be helpful while making dinner together, your partner asks, "Where are the ingredients?" This is part of the Point. Everything else is a Tangent. For example, "You are so disorganized." 


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


You fail less if you assume the Point of any word is different for both sides. Again:


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


During the dialog, a word *said* is not always the same Point or Tangent as it is *heard*.


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


Your partner may feel that the sarcastic afterthought is part of a larger Point. Having already put the ingredients in the pot, you may feel everything your partner said was a Tangent. 


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


You have two options on your turn:


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Point. Assume the Point you heard. Ignore what appears to you or your partner as a Tangent. Speak toward your own Point. "Here's the spoon if you want to stir the ingredients."</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Tangent. To talk about the Tangent is a blatant failure of the dialog. Request to dialog the Tangent later, and/or quit the current dialog.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


All dialog is a Tangent to a result. All Tangents are either a less clear Point, or an example of this essay. Stick to your Point so you can get back to life.
