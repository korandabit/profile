I've spent a year now, making claims of the usefulness of chatbots. Given I'm proposing a new change of behavior, the results are unproven. A common request I've gotten is to share how I personally use chatbots.

I'm venturing in that direction today. I'm going to prioritize sharing actual conversation in favor of giving context about what I'm trying to accomplish, if that's possible. I'll at least get us started.
