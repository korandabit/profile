In a world where AI is both exciting and intimidating, how can you safely explore its potential? The answer lies in structured data formats – plain text files you and your software already use every day.

Many productivity apps use structured text formats like .ics for calendar events and .vcf for contacts. They are designed to store specific information securely, so you don’t need to worry about the AI modifying your existing data or causing harm. You can add new contacts, playlists, tasks, meetings as effectively as you can say describe it. Additionally, if I view their contents, they usually make sense.

Two days ago, I wanted to start a new habit of writing an hour a day. After exploring how I wanted to implement this, Claude made an .ics file. Uploaded into my google calendar, I suddenly had a one hour event recurring for 30 days containing notes to keep me focused.

If you’re ready to explore AI’s potential without the risks, start with “structured data formats.” Ask a chatbot near you if there’s a format it can write to improve your favorite productivity app (or ask me). It’s a safe and controlled way to enhance your digital life.
