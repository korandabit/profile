Tubes have connected the world for decades now, leading to a mass redefinition of social behavior and identity. As obvious as it is, the tangible shift toward something new has yet to be realized. Indeed, many aspects of commerce face a looming question of how, if possible, can we monetize and concretize the online experience?

What is digital seems to stay digital; the physical and digital continue to exist in seemingly parallel universes. Any contact has been superficial or correlative (as opposed to causal), until now. Christian Rudder (Dataclysm) has made contact. He offers a lens on human behavior verified by the hundreds of thousands of observations, which tells a story we've feared hearing: the western world is ubiquitously racist and sexist. For the first time, the internet has had something to say about the real world; the gateway between universes has been open. And, appropriate for such grand opening, Rudder brings gifts and promises of a future for big data. We've been the internet, and the internet is us.
