[Delete "is" from your vocabulary to improve communication](http://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_eprime.html)



E-prime challenges the way you've communicated your most common  feelings through one simple rule: avoid using the verb *be*** **in any of its forms. By doing so you will find yourself more responsible for your feelings, and more clear with your statements. This article discusses the philosophy through it's utility in writing, but it transforms thinking and talking, too. (I tried to write this following the E-prime rule, with much difficulty.)
