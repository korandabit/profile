During covid I hobbied into obsession of the fundamentals to commercial products and their consumption: an extension of the <code>food-cake</code> meditation about things and actions in <code>home</code> and <code>self</code>.

When I *got* covid (<code>x-2021-07</code>) a symptom was impatience. Impatience coupled with isolation, I awoke amidst a hoard of incomplete explorations and wanted out.

This is my Alice escaping Wonderland, sharing what I learned and might leave behind. For a glimpse of Wonderland, see [book2-answers.md]().

## price for utility


<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


Some things have the same utility, but different name.
<code>example-</code>A popcorn bowl is a wide plant bowl and shallow bucket, etc.


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


Cheap, common household goods can add utility.
<code><code>example-</code></code>home glue from--sugar-water-flour
<code><code>example-</code></code>home glue on old cloth to make stiff, custom-fit boards.


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


Many design habits do not cater to living.
<code><code>example-</code></code>windows are too high
<code><code>example-</code></code>couches too low


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


Many methods are left on the table.
<code><code>example-</code></code>tear_mender-as-seam_sealer


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


Discovering improvements in any of these categories fell back on paying attention to what things were made of, and what non-purpose-driven function they had, or as I called it, <code>mechanical function</code>*.*


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


<code>example-</code>Belts limit the distance between two joined points, and/or contain something within their length.


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


These begin to generalize to a <code>mechanical geometry</code>.


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


<code>example-</code>Belts and neckties are both <code>rope</code>.

## goal


<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


*A few months before awaking...*


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


I aim to undercut the price of function for quality daily living. This has the potential to span 3 consumer levels.

**The middle:** You and I are part of the conscientious middle-class (e.g. millennial), interested in reclaiming and customizing materialism for our needs.


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


**The mission:** To provide solutions for the industrious or struggling lower-class.


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->


**The image:** High-end products appeal to and raise viability among the financially secure that want to signal social values and start conversations about materialism.
