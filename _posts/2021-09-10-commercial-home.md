ego

During covid I hobbied into obsession of the fundamentals to commercial products and their consumption: an extension of the food-cake meditation about things and actions in home and self. 

When I *got* covid (x-2021-07) a symptom was impatience. Impatience coupled with isolation, I awoke amidst a hoard of incomplete explorations and wanted out.

This is my Alice escaping Wonderland, sharing what I learned and might leave behind. For a glimpse of Wonderland, see (). 

## price for utility

Some things have the same utility, but different name. example-A popcorn bowl is a wide plant bowl and shallow bucket, etc. 

Cheap, common household goods can add utility. example-home glue from--sugar-water-flour
example-home glue on old cloth to make stiff, custom-fit boards. 

Many design habits do not cater to living. example-windows are too high
example-couches too low

Many methods are left on the table. example-tear_mender-as-seam_sealer

Discovering improvements in any of these categories fell back on paying attention to what things were made of, and what non-purpose-driven function they had, or as I called it, mechanical function*.*

example-Belts limit the distance between two joined points, and/or contain something within their length. 

These begin to generalize to a mechanical geometry. 

example-Belts and neckties are both rope. 

## goal

*A few months before awaking...*

I aim to undercut the price of function for quality daily living. This has the potential to span 3 consumer levels. 

**The middle:** You and I are part of the conscientious middle-class (e.g. millennial), interested in reclaiming and customizing materialism for our needs. 

**The mission:** To provide solutions for the industrious or struggling lower-class. 

**The image:** High-end products appeal to and raise viability among the financially secure that want to signal social values and start conversations about materialism.
