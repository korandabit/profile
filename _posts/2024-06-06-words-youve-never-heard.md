Authors Note

*In writing this essay, I set out to challenge the importance of intellectual property and creative rights by exploring the benefits of letting go of complete ownership of words. As a writer myself, I didn't take the proposal lightly. Over 31 drafts, many crafted with AI assistance, the essay evolved and then stalled.

Hundreds of my drafts and ideas have never seen the light of day; this nearly joined them.*

*What you're reading now is the result of those 31 drafts, stitched together by Claude, an AI assistant, with only light revisions from me. It's both exhilarating and unnerving to embrace this new paradigm of collaborating with AI, but the potential to create works that resonate with every reader is truly transformative.*

Names versus lives

We are in a moment of fundamental change in human existence. Generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT both simplify and strengthen communication. By automating the creation of multiple text variations, AI can drastically alter the impact of words, making it feasible to produce writings that are both individually tailored and broadly accessible. 

For millennia, words have been a tool powered by the human mind. At their best, writers' words, by directing readers' attention, change lives. Many of the great benefits of society are based in language—building codes and prescriptions; religious, educational, and instructional texts; histories and perspectives of possible worlds. You have undoubtedly benefited from the words of people in your life—family, writers, or teachers who have helped you make important decisions and navigate life's challenges. 

However, the nature of written communication imposes fundamental limitations. Writing is one of the most cognitively demanding activities, necessitating a high level of abstraction to speak to commonalities between diverse readers. Effective writing is carefully non-specific. This traditional constraint—rooted in static, single-production texts—means that some of your reality writers will never address. Much of who you are or could be has never been said. 

Words are hard

The challenge of finding the right words is hard. To maximize the value of words, writers must speak to commonalities between readers. This means some of your reality writers will never address. There are two sides to this gap: failing to provide the right background or the right implication. Consider these examples from different fields:

"In the latest trials, positive feedback was observed following the administration of the new chemotherapy agent in high doses." (Medicine)

"The real estate market is finally undergoing the correction that aligns it with current economic conditions." (Economics)

"Due to the model's large learning rate, it rapidly converged in the initial phases of training." (Technology)

Those unfamiliar with these disciplines might read these statements as encouraging, but experts would interpret them differently. In medicine, "positive feedback" from "high doses" of a drug often indicates adverse effects. In economics, a "correction" suggests a significant market downturn. In technology, a model that "converges rapidly" may be overfitting and poorly generalizing. These examples illustrate the crucial need for precise language tailored to the intended audience, bridging the gap between specialist knowledge and general comprehension. 

Made to order

Chatbots have the power to interpret an insight's relevance specifically for you. Imagine a world where the information you consume is tailored to your needs and context. This entire essay could be framed around your current experiences and communicate as if by your best friend. 

Whether you're evaluating the suitability of your lease agreement as a pet owner, seeking an excuse from your course syllabus to attend a family funeral, or looking to boost your career prospects, ChatGPT can help identify and adapt the information that matters most to you. 

Try it out yourself. Open a dialogue with your favorite chatbot, copy-paste this essay's text, and add something about yourself or what's on your mind. Then ask the chatbot to "Adapt the essay to ensure it resonates with themes you find relevant." Experience firsthand how ChatGPT moves words closer to your world. 

R.I.P. Words

Imagine a future where communication is not only less burdensome but also more impactful. Messages could be concise yet potent, allowing for greater achievements with fewer words. This streamlined communication wouldn't just reduce effort but would also free individuals to engage more deeply with meaningful content. By focusing on the effect rather than the original effort of communication, we encourage a broader, more inclusive engagement with knowledge. 

As we embrace this new paradigm, the role of the writer evolves. No longer bound by the constraints of a single, static text, writers can create content that adapts to the needs of each reader. The art of writing becomes a collaborative dance between human creativity and artificial intelligence, producing works that are both personal and universally resonant. 

The power of words, amplified by the adaptive capabilities of AI, has the potential to bridge divides, spark innovation, and foster understanding on an unprecedented scale. As we explore this uncharted territory, we may discover new ways to communicate and understand ourselves and each other. Though I alone published this essay, all that matters is what happens next—how these words take on new life and meaning in the minds and hearts of those who read them. The journey has only just begun.
