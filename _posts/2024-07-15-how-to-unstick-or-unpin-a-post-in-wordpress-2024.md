As WordPress continues to evolve, the process of unsticking a post has changed. This guide provides the most up-to-date method as of 2024. I wrote this after a 2016 and 2023 guide failed to help me find the solution.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Go to the Edit view of the post that has been Pinned/Sticky-ed.

Log in to your WordPress dashboard

Navigate to "Posts" in the left sidebar

Find and click on the sticky post you want to edit

Find the hidden menu for "Status and Visibility"

**4. **In the post editor, look for the single line that reads "Status:" on the right side. It will say "Status: Published" if your post is published, but the exact text may vary (e.g., "Status: Draft" for unpublished posts)

**5. **Click on the status text (e.g., "Published" or "Draft") to open the Status and Visibility panel. This window pops up:

**7. **Click "Update" to save your changes

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

If you don't see these options, ensure you're using the latest WordPress version

Check your user permissions – you may need administrator access

Some themes or plugins might affect the visibility of these options

Remember, WordPress frequently updates its user interface. Always refer to the official WordPress documentation for the most current information.
