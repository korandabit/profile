This is the most recent question I overheard in public--a group talking about their pets' behaviors. People will gladly speak intimately when it is not about themselves. 

How about you?

What is the most interesting question you've heard or asked, recently? **What is the most important question you could ask, right now?**

Never mind what's the most funny or witty. Never mind the questions that are "too deep", or "dramatic". 

**What question are you open to, that if you said it out-loud, would invite the right next steps in your life?**

Never mind what you tell yourself is important. What is the truth to you, right now? 

Embrace every objection you have to this idea, so that you can find whatever honest part of it you can accept. Then take that, put a question mark on it, point it to yourself, smile, and wonder. 

How have your poops been, lately? Can you see beyond the humor in this question (for example, as a doctor might)? How are you living? **What are you prepared to notice or realize in your life, right now?**

Never mind what you "should" or "ought" or "wish". See yourself this second as a question, and the next second as the answer. See that there are options, always. Embrace the answer you chose. 

**What option would you act on simply by noticing?** 

Take this as personally as you can, to your advantage.
