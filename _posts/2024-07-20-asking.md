title: The curious case of asking

I'm reading a book called "Ask". "Ask" is the thesis of the book, too. Let's assume a basic conversation is happening.

All other things equal, asking (instead of "answering" or talking) will improve the engagement of the other person and the likelihood they find you enjoyable. 

Who doesn't want that? There's an inherent asymmetry to questions that creates a unique dynamic in conversations.(#550ebf96-c709-48bd-bc00-55b1f2855a1f" id="550ebf96-c709-48bd-bc00-55b1f2855a1f-link)

The main implied reason is that we don't do it enough. We want to share. There's a darker paradox about this. By asking, you're letting the other person share, that thing we're assuming each of us does too much in the first place. To ask, somewhat relieves the other person of the burden. This dynamic also increases the willingness to engage, creating a positive feedback loop in conversations.(#2654d344-f1f6-4842-80b1-5adbe06da973" id="2654d344-f1f6-4842-80b1-5adbe06da973-link)

When it comes to cognitive effort, it takes less effort to listen than to talk. This suggests a very strong drive to talk, more than to listen. The drive is even stronger if the talker has been explicitly invited, as it confirms that it's warranted. This ask-answer imbalance acts as a positive-effects multiplier in conversations, but doesn't contain intrinsic value alone.(#5b689324-fdee-4e9a-9faa-a7a2712ed52f" id="5b689324-fdee-4e9a-9faa-a7a2712ed52f-link)

A critical question remains: When is it too much? Identifying the right balance and timing for asking versus sharing is key.(#f8958863-78c9-4bed-a73b-ed1d477a3b07" id="f8958863-78c9-4bed-a73b-ed1d477a3b07-link) What makes these gears of human interaction churn the way they do? At face value, a question is merely another group of words. But somehow it has this atomic power to grease the wheels in a unique way.(#e6716ad5-033f-4d4c-b967-2feafcabd3c9" id="e6716ad5-033f-4d4c-b967-2feafcabd3c9-link)

Footnotes

All the footnotes are edits Claude recommended, and I adopted, in revising this document. My criteria for Claude was to increase information and clarity, but decrease word count. Do you think Claude did a good job?(#1eded28e-f8b4-4b28-96d5-9ee857f1d564" id="1eded28e-f8b4-4b28-96d5-9ee857f1d564-link)
