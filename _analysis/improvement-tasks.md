## LOW Priority

### BLOG-001: Investigate "awe" as a featured theme or series anchor
**Category:** Content Strategy
**Effort:** Unknown — needs scoping first
**Priority:** Low/Medium

The dear_ triptych (dear-love, dear-a-i, dear-human) shares a structure built around wonder, address, and transformation. Question: is there enough existing or planned content to warrant an "awe" or wonder-centered theme block on the blog landing page? Possible posts in scope: dear_, know-thaiself, awakening-ai, possibly new writing.

**Next step:** Review whether the two unpublished dear_ placeholders (in essays/2023 ai/) are worth writing or explain why they weren't. Then decide if awe/wonder is a real theme or just three posts.
