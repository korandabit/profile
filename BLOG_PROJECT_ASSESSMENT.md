## Key Preferences & Insights Learned

### Content Curation Philosophy
- **Quality over quantity**: Prefers substantial "big pieces" over shorter/abstract posts
- **200-word assessment method**: Read opening content to gauge depth and substance
- **Avoid fluff**: Rejected "Dear A.I." for being too abstract/poetic for featured positioning
- **Interdisciplinary showcase**: Values displaying breadth of expertise (Military → Academia → Tech → AI)

### Project Management Style  
- **Substantive solutions**: "I prefer you don't proceed with 'mights' and do something a bit more substantive"
- **Root cause analysis**: Expects identification of actual technical constraints (e.g., 650px width issue)
- **Decisive implementation**: "do it. push changes." - prefers action over endless discussion
- **Direct feedback**: Points out when analysis is incorrect ("from my screenshot you're clearly not seeing correctly")

### Technical Approach
- **Systematic expansion**: Grew themes from 5→19 posts via quality assessment
- **Strategic theme creation**: Added "Language Science" to showcase academic credentials
- **Clean implementation**: Prefers local page-specific fixes over global changes
- **Commit discipline**: Appreciates clear, descriptive commit messages with context

### Content Strategy Insights
- **AI theme as flagship**: Strongest recent work, should lead
- **Featured vs comprehensive**: Distinguish between curated highlights and full catalog
- **Academic credibility**: Language Science theme bridges research and practical insights
- **Personal authenticity**: CODA, veteran, and PhD experiences inform unique perspective
