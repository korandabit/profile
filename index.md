## [Blog](/blog)
Meditations outside the box (AI, society) for human well-being (self and other).

## Tech  
I specialize in designing human-AI interface (prompt engineering). I have 2 years industry experience in software design and consulting, and more than 10 years as a cognitive psychologist. Currently open to human-first AI projects, for consultation. Previously a Software Design Engineer at [Edge RnD](edgernd.com).

## PhD  
I graduated with my PhD in Psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in 2022. I was recognized for [my advocacy work](https://grad.wisc.edu/diversity/graduate-student-service-scholarships/) by the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Last fall (2021) I had the pleasure of designing and teaching a Capstone course on applied writing interventions, "Language Use as Self-Growth", in which 23 students spent an entire semester writing to themselves, administering writing interventions on each other, and analyzing which words lead to learning.

## [Cognition of Language Use](http://lcnl.wisc.edu/index.php/mark-koranda/)
Language is a sophisticated cognitive tool for sharing and coordinating, often about things neither here nor now. 
Like any tool used in real-time with constantly changing demands, we can't expect it to work perfectly. 
In other words, "good-enough" decisions that avoid mental interference, or take advantage of whatever comes to mind first. 

My dissertation shows evidence that when there are multiple ways to say something, what comes to mind will tend to be words that sound less like what you just said (we avoid alliteration), and a slight preference for words that you generally know more (prefer high frequency words)--even if they're not quite right for what you mean.

I have also investigated:  

- why some gestures come to mind more quickly than others.  
- how gestures come to mind when words fail us.  
- the similarity in mechanisms of [verbal and (non-verbal) action plans](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01193/full).

## Deaf Advocacy  
Much of my research is influenced by my identity and culture. For me, the goal of (even) basic science is to address real-world problems. I am bi-cultural, raised in both the Deaf community and the broader hearing culture. Check out my blog to learn more about [the intersection of these communities](https://thoughtrepair.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/talk-about-deafhood/). 

## Military Awareness  
Before Undergrad, I served in Afghanistan with the Marine Corps. During my deployment and after, I wrote about [the complexity of being a Marine](https://thoughtrepair.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/the-unedited-war-story-of-a-veteran/), an informed citizen and a mediator for an often uninformed population. 

## Skilled Reflection  
Language is a powerful tool. It is also a dangerous one. We can be lured into many linguistic vices like fantasies and fake news. We can also leverage our reasoning ability against these vices on the things we care most about. 

The purpose of [Skilled Reflection](https://skilledreflection.org) is to intensely subject our personal meaning and meaning-making ("goals") to the measured, objective reality of our habits. It is a University Club I made up where students come together for focused writing, accountability, and a shared interest in practically increasing the good stuff in life.
