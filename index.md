## Cognition of Language Use
We use language to accomplish specific tasks, often to communicate information. 
As a tool, linguistic knowledge is extremely complex, and yet communication is often spontaneous. 
My research investigates the various "shortcuts" we unknowingly take to meet the demands of communication.
Currently, I am a dissertator in the [Language and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://lcnl.wisc.edu/index.php/mark-koranda/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and 
I am researching biases in how words come to mind. 

I have also investigated 
- why some gestures come to mind more quickly than others
- how gestures come to mind when words fail us 
- repeating patterns across our sentences

## Deaf and Military Writing
Much of my research is influenced by my identity and culture. You can get both an introduction and deep dive into these from my blog. I explore aspects of [Deaf culture](https://thoughtrepair.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/talk-about-deafhood/) and [military identity](https://thoughtrepair.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/the-unedited-war-story-of-a-veteran/).

## Skilled Reflection
Language is a powerful tool. It is also a dangerous one. We can be lured into many linguistic vices like fantasies and false news. With [Skilled Reflection](https://skilledreflection.org) the power of language can help clarify reality through critical investigation of our individual experiences.
