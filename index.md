## Lecturer  
Having recently defended my dissertation, I am currently teaching introductory Psycholinguistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, while crafting the next step in my career. Last fall (2021) I had the pleasure of designing and teaching a Capstone course on applied writing interventions, "Language Use as Self-Growth", in which 23 students spent an entire semester writing to themselves, administering writing interventions on each other, and analyzing which words lead to learning.

## [Cognition of Language Use](http://lcnl.wisc.edu/index.php/mark-koranda/)
Language is a sophisticated cognitive tool for sharing and coordinating, often about things neither here nor now. 
Like any tool used in real-time with constantly changing demands, we can't expect it to work perfectly.
What would imperfect language...mean? 
It would mean "good-enough" decisions that avoid mental interference, or take advantage of whatever comes to mind first. 
My dissertation shows evidence that when there are multiple ways to say something, what comes to mind will tend to be words that sound less like what you just said (we avoid alliteration), and a slight preference for words that you generally know more (prefer high frequency words)--even if they're not quite right for what you mean.

I have also investigated:  

- why some gestures come to mind more quickly than others.  
- how gestures come to mind when words fail us.  
- the similarity in mechanisms of [verbal and (non-verbal) action plans](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01193/full).

## Deaf Advocacy  
Much of my research is influenced by my identity and culture. For me, basic science is inextricably linked to fundamental real-world problems. I consider myself bi-cultural, raised in both the Deaf community and the broader hearing culture.

## Military Awareness  
At the time of writing, it is March 8th, 2022. Russia has been waging war on Ukraine for almost two weeks, and "the West" is hardly half a year past a bloody withdrawal from a war of over 20 years. It is as good a time as any to reconcile our ideals with our actions. Though, in my view, any time is not enough time to reconcile. I served in Afghanistan with the Marine Corps over a decade ago. What is there to say about it all? War, like the human mind, is chaos. I also have other words about [military-identity politics](https://thoughtrepair.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/the-unedited-war-story-of-a-veteran/).

## Skilled Reflection  
In my final lecture, I imagine I would argue and campaign for this. 
Language is a powerful tool. It is also a dangerous one. We can be lured into many linguistic vices like fantasies and fake news. We can also leverage our reasoning ability against these vices on the things we care most about. The purpose of [Skilled Reflection](https://skilledreflection.org) is to intensely subject our personal meaning and meaning-making ("goals") to the measured, objective reality of our habits.
